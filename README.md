## About me

Hello! I am looking for a job (job/internship). I am applying for the position of Junior Frontend Engineer. What I can add about myself: all my life I have been organizing events and promoting my services on the Internet, but by profession I am an automation engineer and a psychologist with a second education. I like to think outside the box, think and analyze a lot. 

I love beautiful and high-quality sites and applications, and would like to have a hand in creating a really high-quality and user-friendly application. I want to be part of a cool team of dedicated professionals.

I am sure that my meticulousness, imaginative and analytical thinking will help me find my place in IT.
